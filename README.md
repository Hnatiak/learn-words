<h1>Customizing Tests</h1>
To customize the tests for yourself, follow these steps:

1. Download VSCode ```https://code.visualstudio.com/```
2. Open VSCode and console (Ctrl + ` or Terminal > New Terminal)
3. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/Hnatiak/learn-words.git```
4. Navigate to the script.js file and modify the words according to your preferences:

```javascript
const jsonData = {
    "translate": {
        "write here": "write here",
        "write here": "write here"
    }
};

Note: The first word represents the question or item you want to translate, and the second word is the correct answer.

For example:

"Hello": "it's greetings",
"How are you?": "it's question...",
