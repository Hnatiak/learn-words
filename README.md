<h1>Customizing Tests</h1>
To customize the tests for yourself, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/Hnatiak/learn-words.git```
Navigate to the script.js file and modify the words according to your preferences.

Note: The first word represents the question or item you want to translate, and the second word is the correct answer.

For example:

"Hello": "it's greetings",
"How are you?": "it's question...",
